## Kasa – A Modern Rental Platform

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

Kasa is a modern web application designed for property rentals. Built with React and React Router, the platform focuses on delivering a seamless and responsive user experience. This project emphasizes component-based architecture, dynamic routing, and modular code organization to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Project Overview

The Kasa project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, including the use of React and React Router to build a single-page application (SPA). The platform incorporates modular components and reusable code to ensure scalability and maintainability. It’s designed to be intuitive for users, with a responsive layout for all devices.

### Technical Features

Kasa highlights several key technical features:

- Dynamic Property Listings: Each property has its own dynamically generated page with specific details.
- React Router Integration: Enables smooth navigation across the application.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Error Management: Custom 404 error page to handle invalid routes gracefull

#### Key Takeaways

- Strengthened my understanding of React and component-based architecture.
- Learned best practices for dynamic routing with React Router.
- Gained experience in responsive design and cross-device testing.
